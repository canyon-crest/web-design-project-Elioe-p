  <p>Outside of school, <span class="highlight">I have a wide range of hobbies such as coding, reading, playing badminton, etc.</span> These activities help me relax from the school work and release pressure. I'm also participating in <span class="highlight">volunteer work</span> outside of school frequently. The organization I volunteer is an elder teaching program in <a href="https://aylus.org/branches/san-diego-ca/" target="_blank">AYLUS San Diego branch</a>. In the future, I hope to gain achievements in computing and go to a great college. And I wish I can find a job related to digital technology or programming in the future. I will continuously learn and work hard to achieve my dreams and contribute positively to society.</p>
